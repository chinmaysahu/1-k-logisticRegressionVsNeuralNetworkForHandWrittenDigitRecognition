# 1 to k-logisticRegressionVsNeuralNetworkForHandWrittenDigitRecognition
In this project, we implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

Here, logistic regression and neural networks are used to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). Automated handwritten digit
recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. This project shows my attempts to solve this problem using logistic regression and neural network.
